       <h1>Muhammad ﷺ : Legacy of Wisdom and Compassion</h1>
      <h3>محمد ﷺ: تراث الحكمة والرحمة</h3>
      <p>Prophet Muhammad, born in Mecca in 570 CE, holds a central and revered position in Islam as the final prophet. 
        His life is intricately woven into the fabric of Islamic history, marked by a profound spiritual journey. At the age of 40
        , he received revelations from Allah through the angel Jibreel (Gabriel), leading to the compilation of the Quran, the 
        sacred text of Islam. Beyond his role as a spiritual leader, Muhammad, peace be upon him (ﷺ), exemplified virtues 
        of compassion, humility, and justice, earning him the title Al-Amin (the Trustworthy) even before his prophethood. 
        His teachings emphasized monotheism, social justice, and moral conduct, shaping the ethical framework of Islamic civilization. 
        The Prophet life serves as a source of inspiration for millions, illustrating a model of piety, resilience, and devotion to God. </p>

      <h1>HI<span>STORY</span></h1>
  <div id="child">
    <div class="childhood">
      <h2>CHILDHOOD <span>طفولة</span></h2>
      <p>Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in the year 570 at Mecca, a mountain village on western Arabia’s high desert plains (Saudi Arabia now).
        He was the only child of Amina bint Wahb and her late spouse, Abd Allah bin Al-Muttalib, who died before Muhammad (PBUH) was born. He was raised in the hill highlands of Mecca by his mother Amina in his early years.
        In 575, Amina died, and his caregiver, Halima, took Muhammad (PBUH) to his grandfather, Abdul Al-Muttalib, which was a breakthrough in his life.
        During these years, Muhammad (PBUH) learned the principles of statecraft. Since he was a child, he has been one of the most trusted people. Mecca was Arabia’s most significant pilgrimage center, and Abdul Al-Muttalib was its most revered ruler. He wielded great control over pilgrimage concessions and presided over Mecca’s Council of Elders regularly.
        When his grandpa died in 578, he was raised for several years by his uncle Abu Talib. He continued to learn from the elders, earning him a stellar reputation.
        Because he was trustworthy at such a young age, various traders appointed him as their agent to handle major commercial matters on their behalf. People were completely happy with Muhammad prophet (PBUH) honesty since he carried out these trusts so well.
        As a result, the people held him in high regard and referred to him as Sadiq (the honest) and Amin (the trustworthy).</p>

    <div class="miracles">
      <h2><span>MIRACLES</span> معجزات </h2>
      
      <h3>End o<span>f Drought</span></h3>
      <p>The first miracle happened when Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was just a baby. As a part of Mecca traditions, when the child is born, they are assigned to a woman to breastfeed them until they are two years old. And that woman was Halima Al-Saa’di.
        Halima described the year they brought Muhammad to her. She stated that they were in a year of drought and that there was no grazing, and that they only had a sheep that did not produce a single drop of milk. Her son was usually hungry, and he cried all night from that hunger.
        Goodness and nourishment flowed to them from everywhere as soon as she took muhammad the prophet, peace be upon him, thus they got filled after hunger, their sheep are milked after dryness, and both their boy and Muhammad (PBUH) are nursed till they are full and hydrated.
        Bani Saad never witnessed another drought in the two years he was there. When he was supposed to be carried back to his mother, the residents of Bani Sa’ad were saddened since the kid who brought all the goodness was no longer among them.
        When he was a little older, this happened again at Mecca. For weeks, people suffered from drought until Abu Talib led him to the Kaaba, placed his back against its walls, and waited for rain. Surprisingly, the rain flooded Mecca and people were saved as soon as he did it.</p>
         <br>
        <h3><span>The He</span>art Split </h3> 
      <p>The second miracle is the most well-known. He was four or five years old at the time. Muhammad and his friends were playing outdoors when they noticed a gigantic figure, Jibreel, approaching them. Except for Anas Ibn Malik, who waited there observing what happened, they all fled.
        Jibreel split Muhammad’s chest, pulled out his heart, removed a little black part, and stated, “That’s the devil’s entrance to you.” He washed it in a bowl of gold and Zamzam water before returning it.
        Anas Ibn Malik panicked and dashed to Halima, claiming that Muhammad had been murdered by an unnamed person. When they hurried to check what it was, they found him alive and unhurt. Anas Ibn Malik used to remark that he could still see Muhammad’s stitches on his chest.
        Our Prophet’s childhood miracle stories are a wonderful way to introduce him to your children. Children enjoy strange stories and may learn a lot from them. Get them books of as sirah an nabawiyyah of prophet Muhammad for kids and extract the lessons learned from them.
        This can be done by explaining how Allah (SWT) was preparing Muhammad for prophecy and how nothing made sense until Allah revealed His revelation. 
        The same thing might happen to us; we may encounter events for which we do not comprehend the meaning, but it is only a matter of time until Allah reveals it to us. The most important thing to remember is to have faith in Allah (SWT) and to be patient.</p> 
        <br>
        <h3>Beauty of <span>Quran</span></h3>
        <h4>The first is the one that we can see to this day: the Holy Qur’an. In the 88th verse of Surah Al-Isra ', Allah the Almighty says:</h4>
        <h5>قُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الْإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَىٰ أَن يَأْتُوا بِمِثْلِ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ لَا يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا</h5>
        <span class="sp">Say, ‘Even if all mankind and jinn came together to produce something like this Quran, they could not produce anything like it, however much they helped each other.’ [17:88] </span>
        <p>As we know, the Qur'an contains beautiful language that neither humans nor jinn could create a book such as it. It contains ancient stories related to the prophets and apostles, Peace be upon them all,  it contains verses that explain knowledge related to scientific findings and describing things related to the Shari’a, 
           it also tells the unseen creatures and realms such as the angels, jinns, heaven, and hellfire.</p>
           <br>
        <h3><span>Story of</span> Isr'a and Mi'raj</h3>
        <h4>Every Muslim knows about the story of Isra’ Mi’raj. This miraculous event occurred at a time when Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was faced with trials and tribulations, and it was even known as the Year of Sorrw (‘Am al-Huzun). </h4>
        <h5>سُبحانَ الَّذي أَسرىٰ بِعَبدِهِ لَيلًا مِنَ المَسجِدِ الحَرامِ إِلَى المَسجِدِ الأَقصَى الَّذي بارَكنا حَولَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِن آياتِنا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّميعُ البَصيرُ</h5>
        <span class="sp">“Glory to Him who made His servant travel by night from the sacred place of worship to the furthest place of worship, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him some of Our signs: He alone is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.” [Qur’an 17:1]</span>
        <p>The night journey and ascension begins with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ travelling with the Angel Jibril, Peace be upon him, on a heavenly creation called al Buraq to Masjid al-Aqsa, in Jerusalem. This is also one of the most amazing miracles of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, a unique creation that travels faster than the speed of light, quite incomprehensible to the human mind.
          According to a hadith, al Buraq is one of the animals of paradise and is described as <span id="h">“a white creature that is larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place its hoof (step) a distance equal to the range of his vision." (Sahih Al-Bukhari)</span>
          Upon reaching Masjid al-Aqsa, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ led all of the earlier Prophets, peace be upon them all, in prayer. 
          The second part of the journey brings Prophet Muhammad’s ascension to the heavens with Jibril, Peace be upon him. During the ascension, he met other Prophets before him.
          When he finally reached the highest level in the heavens, he was brought into the Divine Presence of Allah the Almighty, alone at Sidratul Muntaha (a boundary beyond which none may pass). It is said to be the boundary that has never been passed by anyone except by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Here, Rasulullah ﷺ was given the Divine Decree for the believers to establish daily prayers, and it is also when he kept returning back and forth to Allah, the Merciful for a lesser number of obligatory prayers.
          Eventually, the number of compulsory prayers were reduced to five. Upon being given that by Allah the Merciful, Rasulullah ﷺ no longer continued to ask for more, and from then, the practice of five daily prayers was established. 
          Due to that miraculous event, Muslims today pray five times a day to Allah the Almighty, from all over the world, from mosques to houses and many places where prayers can be observed.</p>   
          <br>
        <h3>The Splitting o<span>f the moon</span></h3>
        <h4>The second is when Prophet Muhammad ﷺ splits the moon into two.
          This historical event is mentioned in the hadith narrated by Imam Bukhari:</h4>
        <h5>حَدَّثَنِي عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ عَبْدِ الْوَهَّابِ، حَدَّثَنَا بِشْرُ بْنُ الْمُفَضَّلِ، حَدَّثَنَا سَعِيدُ بْنُ أَبِي عَرُوبَةَ، عَنْ قَتَادَةَ، عَنْ أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ ـ رضى الله عنه أَنَّ أَهْلَ، مَكَّةَ سَأَلُوا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنْ يُرِيَهُمْ آيَةً، فَأَرَاهُمُ الْقَمَرَ شِقَّتَيْنِ، حَتَّى رَأَوْا حِرَاءً بَيْنَهُمَ</h5>
        <span class="sp">Narrated Anas bin Malik: The people of Mecca asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to show them a miracle. So he showed them the moon split in two halves between which they saw the Hira' mountain.</span>
        <p>This event occurred when the infidels asked the Prophet ﷺ to prove his prophethood by splitting the moon into two. By the will of Allah Almighty, when the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ pointed to the moon, it happened.</p>

   <div id="mekkah">
    <h2><span>MEKKAH LIFE <i class="fa-solid fa-kaaba"></i></span> حياة مكة</h2>
    <p>Prophet Muhammad's life in Mecca, after the formative years of his childhood, is a tale of profound spiritual awakening, persistent dedication to his divine mission, and the enduring resilience of the early Muslim community. At the age of 40, while meditating in the Cave of Hira,
       he received the first revelations from the Angel Jibreel (A.S), initiating his prophethood. Initially sharing the message privately, Prophet Muhammad faced increasing opposition from the Quraysh, the predominant tribe in Mecca, as he openly called people to monotheism and the worship of one God.
      This period witnessed the steadfastness of early Muslims in the face of severe persecution. Social boycotts, economic sanctions, and physical torture aimed at suppressing the spread of Islam did not deter the Prophet or his followers. Some sought refuge in Abyssinia, under the protection of 
      the Christian king, Negus. The Year of Sorrow brought personal grief with the deaths of the Prophet's wife Khadijah and his uncle Abu Talib. Undeterred, he continued his mission, extending invitations to various clans and tribes during the annual pilgrimage seasons.
      The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in 628 CE marked a turning point. Though a truce, it allowed for a period of relative peace, during which the Muslim community grew stronger. In 630 CE, the Prophet, now with a substantial following, peacefully entered Mecca after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was violated. The city embraced Islam, and the idols in the Kaaba were removed.
      In his final years in Mecca, Prophet Muhammad experienced the miraculous Night Journey and Ascension, 
      a profound spiritual encounter. But Prophet and his companions were forced to leave their home by the disbelievers. And then began the second stage of prophet's life.</p>
   </div>

   <div id="madeena">
    <h2>MADEENA LIFE <i class="fa-solid fa-mosque"></i><span> حياة المدينة المنورة</span></h2>
    <p>The Prophet (PBUH)'s life in Madeena was the 2nd stage of prophethood in his life. It lasted 10 years until
      he died. It was also the widespread time of Islam. The Prophet adopted somany ways to develop the bond
      between Muslim Community and Madeeena and Muslims in Mekkah. The Prophet first built Masjid Quba after reaching
      Madeena. Then near his house he built Masjid un Nabawi along with every Muslims. He himself worked in this construction.
      In this 10 years somany wars were fought. They include Battle of Badr, Uhud and Khandaq. Then a pact named Hudaybiyyah
      was held between Muslims and Quraish. But the Quraish broke the rules in this pact. As a result the prophet along
      with 10,000 companions went to fight to win back Mekkah. This was the conquest of mekkah. The prophet gave the last speech of
      his life at the Arafa and it is mentioned in a box at last. After a few months he passed away at the house of Aisha (R.A). But he was the person
      who united the muslims and so the greatest ever man to live in planet earth.</p>

    <div id="speech">
      <div class="speech-box">
        <p>"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.<br><br>
          All praise is due to Allah. We praise Him, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. 
          We seek refuge with Allah from the evil within ourselves and from our wrongdoings. 
          Whomever Allah guides will never be led astray, and whomever Allah leads astray will 
          never find guidance. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, alone without any partners, 
          and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.<br><br>
          To proceed: O people, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether, after this year, I shall 
          ever be amongst you again. Therefore, listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and take 
          these words to those who could not be present here today.<br><br>
          O people, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as sacred, so regard the life and 
          property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful 
          owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, 
          and that He will indeed reckon your deeds. Allah has forbidden you to take usury (interest), 
          therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours 
          to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity.<br><br>
          Allah has judged that there shall be no interest, and that all the 
          interest due to Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib shall henceforth be waived.<br><br>
          Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he 
          will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.<br><br>
          O people, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, 
          but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives 
          only under Allah’s trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to 
          them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to 
          them, for they are your partners and committed helpers.<br><br>
          All mankind is from Adam and Eve. An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor does a 
          non-Arab have any superiority over an Arab; white has no superiority over black, nor does 
          a black have any superiority over white; [none have superiority over another] 
          except by piety and good action.<br><br>
          Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute 
          one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim, which belongs to a fellow 
          Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, 
          do injustice to yourselves.<br><br>
          Remember, one day you will appear before Allah and answer for your deeds. So beware, 
          do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.<br><br>
          O people, no prophet or apostle will come after me, and no new faith will be born. 
          Reason well, therefore, O people, and understand words, which I convey to you. 
          I leave behind me two things, the Quran and my example, the Sunnah, and if you 
          follow these you will never go astray.<br><br>
          All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; 
          and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. 
          Be my witness, O Allah, that I have conveyed your message to your people."</p>

      <h1><span>HAD</span>EES</h1>
      <p>In Islam, a "Hadith" or "Hadees" (Arabic: حديث) refers to the sayings, actions, approvals, 
        or disapprovals of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Hadiths serve as a crucial source of 
        guidance for Muslims, providing insights into the Prophet's way of life, his teachings, and 
        the application of Islamic principles in various situations.The two primary sources of Islamic 
        guidance are the Quran and the Hadith. While the Quran is the holy book revealed to Prophet Muhammad 
        (peace be upon him) through the angel Gabriel, the Hadith consists of the recorded words and 
        actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).Hadiths are classified into different categories 
        based on their authenticity and reliability. Scholars have spent centuries scrutinizing and verifying 
        the chain of narrators (Isnad) and the content (Matn) of each Hadith to categorize them into various 
        levels of authenticity. The two most recognized collections of Hadith are Sahih Bukhari and Sahih 
        Muslim, known for their stringent criteria in accepting Hadiths.Muslims turn to Hadiths to better 
        understand the context and application of Quranic teachings in their daily lives. Hadiths offer 
        guidance on various aspects of life, including morality, ethics, legal principles, rituals, and 
        interpersonal relationships. However, it's essential to note that not all Hadiths are of equal 
        authenticity, and scholars use a rigorous methodology to distinguish between reliable and less 
        reliable narrations.In summary, Hadiths are an integral part of Islamic tradition, providing 
        additional details and context to the teachings found in the Quran. They help Muslims understand 
        how to implement the principles of Islam in their lives by following the example set by Prophet 
        Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>
